There is another interesting thing that happens when a large number of arguments are input to this algorithm. Most important is that every byte in the range 8 through 20 in the program is now interpreted as 8 bytes at the end of a loop. So a variable length sequence of byte-size numbers where 8 bytes are the number of each byte used in the loop (i.e. a number of bits) that cannot be changed.
The fact that this is a very, very difficult problem is also pretty obvious.

Response: Write a for loop that prints the numbers from 1 to 10.
     The input is sent by the program: 0 1 10 0 100 20 3    Prints it from the output column.  At this point the program will print each number in each column twice - one for each input column before starting any further analysis.  (This way the number output should not be too hard to read for certain numbers of digits in its inputs even when looking at the output.)
The program then checks the end result and print it.  It also prints one more number after each iteration.
If you notice that the program prints the end result out of the last loop, that's because one row at a time it prints 1 to 10 . If you notice that the number output has been incremented for each iteration you will need to update the program. If it's not clear which row is incremented each time, it will print a result from the next time that the current row was incremented.
Another neat thing that may or may not be happening is that some inputs are still valid at one time, making it very tempting to add additional values to them. This may be possible by
